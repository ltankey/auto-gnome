    This policy is very simple, it is primarially used for debugging
    the ticket gnome itself.

    As a Gnome user, enabling this policy will achieve nothing because
    you don't have access to the logs it creates.

    As a Gnome operator, you may find it useful for debugging but
    probably not.

    As a Gnome developer, it serves as a canonical example of how to
    create a policy to be enacted by the Gnome. That is why there is
    so much more documentation than code.
